🏡 Bangalore Housing Price Prediction

A Machine Learning Project to predict housing prices in Bangalore using supervised learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model building, and deployment as a web application.

📌 Project Objectives

Build a supervised ML model to predict housing prices.

Perform predictive analysis using regression techniques.

Provide an interactive web application for end-users to estimate housing prices based on features.

📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Bengaluru House Price Data.

It contains information such as location, size, total square feet, number of bathrooms, and price.

⚙️ Tech Stack
🔹 Machine Learning & Data Analysis

Python

Numpy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🔹 Web Application & Deployment

Flask

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Deployment on Heroku

Live Demo 👉 Bangalore Housing Price Prediction App

📒 Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and outlier removal.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of trends and correlations.

Modeling:
